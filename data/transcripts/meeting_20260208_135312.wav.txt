 Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's standup.
 Let's start with project updates.
 Sarah, how's the dashboard coming along?
 Hi, the dashboard is about 80% done.
 I finished the charts yesterday and I'm working on the filters today.
 I should have it ready for review by Thursday.
 Every progress any blockers, actually yes, I need access to the production database
 to test with real data, can someone help me with that?
 I'll send you the credentials of the school mic, what about the IPI integration?
 The API is done and I deploy to staging.
 I run into a bug with the authentication flow, but I fix it this morning.
 I'll write the documentation today.
 Perfect.
 So the decision is, will aim for a demo on Friday?
 My, can you provide the staging environment?
 And Sarah, please have the dashboard ready by Thursday so that we can do a dry run.
 Any questions?
 No.
 Great.
 Let's think again tomorrow.
 Thanks everyone.
